# Reopeningproject
The data files shared in this project are used to support the findings of our paper: 
Anatomy into the battle of supporting or opposing reopening amid the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter: a temporal and spatial analysis.

We used Twitter Standard Search API and the key search term "reopen" to search related tweets in the date range from April 17 to May 30, 2020 to investigate people's perceptions emerged on Twitter platform to support or oppose reopening policy. Restrictions apply to the availability of Twitter data, which are used under license for the current study, and so specific user information or tweets messages are not publicly available. The tweet IDs are however available from the authors upon reasonable request, but the original tweets/posts are available with permission of the Twitter Inc. We share the supplementary data files in this page to support the findings of our paper and other possible research purposes.  

Classification results -- the classification labels for tweets returned by the text classification pipeline. Each data file has three columns: the date and time, state location, and the perception supporting or opposing reopening policy. The time range covers the date from April 17 to May 30, 2020. 

Data for analysis -- this folder mainly contains two data files. The file "data for analysis" shows the process to compute the perception on both temporal and spatial angles and and other geo-demographic factors. The file "state distribution" shows the perception supporting reopening for each state on a weekly basis. 

Paper (figures and analysis) -- this folder contains the data files that were used to generate the figures and other reopening policy related sources to support the findings of our paper.
